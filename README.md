# NodeJS Basic Routing Project
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to illustrate an understanding of basic NodeJS concepts. Most of the NodeJS code can be found in the index.js file.

## Description
This web application allows the user to access data on a product depending on which card they click on. I have implemented a very simple API to read
in data from a JSON file and display it on to the page. I decided to use the http module as my routing solution. The id in the route changes based on the
information returned by the API when a product is clicked on.

## Sources
The front end for this web application was developed by Jonas Schmedtmann, my NodeJS instructor. His website can be found here: codingheroes.io
